# Change Log
## Version 0.1
### 09/14/2020
- The boi rotates
The player character now rotates to face the direction of movement. Still has kinks but progress is progress
- Joystick input
Because mouse controls were lame. Can be toggled on and off in game conroller script
- Local multiplayer
Began to set up requirements for local multiplayer. (number of players on the menu). Need to figure out split screen vs top down when local multiplayer.
  - Thinking top down only for local multiplayer.
  - Top down, first person, and third person for single player networked matches.

### 09/13/2020
- Added simple character and camera controls
Created a first person and third person camera (toggle using 'c'). Movement of character changes based upon camera chosen. Third person needs somw work.
-Added terrain and kill volume
Set up basic terrain to be sculpted later. Attached kill volume, currently just logs if player exits trigger.


### 09/11/2020
- Started Development
Spent some time setting up the menu logic before development so testing restarts are much easier.
- Main Menu
Created a basic main menu. It has a start button and a setting button. The settings button currently just loads a pop-up pannel, future proofing for now. Needs an exit game button.
- Pause Menu
Made a sample scene and created a pause menu. Have to fix that you can't exit with a key press but the buttons work.
