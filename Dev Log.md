## Version 0.1
### 09/11/2020
- Started Development
Spent some time setting up the menu logic before development so testing restarts are much easier.
- Main Menu
Created a basic main menu. It has a start button and a setting button. The settings button currently just loads a pop-up pannel, future proofing for now. Needs an exit game button.
- Pause Menu
Made a sample scene and created a pause menu. Have to fix that you can't exit with a key press but the buttons work.
